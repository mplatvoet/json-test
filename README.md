# json-test
Java/Jackson Unittest helpers for testing Json results.

Build this for a customer where I want to test various json results. The value of the actual json does not exactly need to match the expected Json. However the actual value should contain all the required values to create the expected value. This allows for adding extra information without tests automatically failing.
